# Java Basics

## 1. What is Java? Why is it platform-independent?
Java is a high-level, well-organized, object-oriented programming language where everything is defined within classes. It is platform-independent because, after coding, the source code is compiled into **bytecode**, which can run on any system (Linux, Windows, macOS) using the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. This concept is known as **"Write Once, Run Anywhere"**.

## 2. What is the JDK, JRE, and JVM?
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Complete package for writing, compiling, debugging, and running Java code.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** Provides necessary libraries to run Java applications. It contains the JVM.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Executes Java bytecode, making Java platform-independent.

**Relationships:**
- JDK: Builds bytecode using the Java Compiler (`javac`).
- JRE: Runs bytecode using the JVM.
- JVM: Executes bytecode.

## 3. What is bytecode in Java?
Bytecode is the intermediate, platform-independent code generated by the Java compiler. It is stored in `.class` files and can be executed on any system with a JVM.

## 4. What is a class in Java?
A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects will have. Declared using the `class` keyword.

## 5. What is a method in Java?
A method is a block of code that performs a specific task. It is defined inside a class and includes a return type, method name, parameters, and a body of code.

## 6. What is a variable?
- **Local Variables:** Stored in Stack Memory.
- **Instance Variables:** Stored in Heap Memory.
- **Static Variables:** Stored in the Method Area (part of Heap).
- **Object References:** Stored in Stack Memory, but the actual objects are in the Heap.

## 7. Primitive vs Non-Primitive
| Type              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Primitive**     | Basic types like `int`, `char`, `boolean`, `float`, stored directly in the stack. |
| **Non-Primitive** | Reference types like `String`, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces. References are stored in the stack, actual objects in the heap. |

## 8. Difference between `==` and `.equals()`

| Feature                | `==` Operator                       | `.equals()` Method                        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Basic Purpose          | Compares memory addresses           | Compares content (values)                 |
| Applicable to          | Primitives and Object references    | Only Objects                              |
| Used for               | Checking if two references are same | Checking if two objects are logically equal |
| Primitives Example     | `int a = 10; int b = 10; a == b` → True | Not applicable                          |
| Objects Example        | `String s1 = "Hello"; String s2 = "Hello";` <br> `s1 == s2` → True | `s1.equals(s2)` → True |
| Custom Behavior        | Cannot be overridden                | Can be overridden in custom classes       |

## 9. What is the purpose of `main()`?
The `main()` method is the **entry point** of any Java application. It is the first method the JVM calls to start program execution. Without it, a Java program cannot run.

## 10. What is typecasting in Java?
Typecasting is converting one data type to another.

- **Implicit Typecasting:** Automatic, safe (e.g., `int` to `double`).
- **Explicit Typecasting:** Manual, may result in data loss (e.g., `double` to `int`).

## 11. Heap vs Stack

| Feature         | Stack                                      | Heap                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Stores           | Local variables, method calls, references  | Objects and instance variables       |
| Speed            | Faster                                     | Slower                               |
| Size             | Limited                                    | Larger                               |
| Access           | LIFO (Last In, First Out)                  | Dynamic                              |
| Thread Safety    | Thread-safe                                | Shared among all threads             |
